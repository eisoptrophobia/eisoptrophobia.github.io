 <h3>Square Roots</h3>
<p>Square roots, square roots,<br>
They are very square roots.<br>
The square root of thirty-two's not 9,<br>
Square roots are very fine.<br>
I like square roots, and you should, too,<br>
They are very good for you.<br>
Square roots, square roots,<br>
They are very square roots.<br>
Square roots are an exponent,<br>
That is not you opponent.<br>
I like bacon, and you should, too,<br>
Though it isn't good for you.<br></p>
 <br>
 <h3>Multiplication</h3><br>
<p>Multiplication is so fun,<br>
You can do it well eating a bun.<br>
You can multiply anything,<br>
Even "yams" and "a roasted wing"<br>
Multiplication is so cool,<br>
You can do it at school.<br>
You should try jelly it tastes so sweet,<br>
But multiplication makes it taste like feet.<br>
Multiplication is so grand,<br>
You can do it on the palm of your hand.<br>
I once saw someone who wasn't cool,<br>
Because he didn't learn multiplication at school.<br></p>
 <br>
 <h3>Powers of Ten</h3>
<p>One ten one hundred<br>
One thousand ten thousand<br>
Hundred thousand million too<br>
Powers of ten are good for you<br>
<br><br>
Powers of ten<br>
They never end<br>
One zero zero<br>
Zero zero zero<br>
<br><br>
Easy to calculate<br>
Divide multiply why wait<br>
A one followed by some zeroes<br>
I donâ€™t know what rhymes with zeroes<br>
<br><br>
Powers of ten<br>
They never end<br>
One zero zero zero<br> 
Zero zero zero<br>
<br><br>
They can be less that ten<br>
Like one tenth or hundredth<br>
Take ten and multiply<br>
It by itself some times<br>
<br><br>
Powers of ten<br>
They never end<br>
One zero zero<br>
Zero zero<br>
