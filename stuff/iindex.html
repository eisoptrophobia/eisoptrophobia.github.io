 <h3>Square Roots</h3>
<p>Square roots, square roots,
They are very square roots.
The square root of thirty-two's not 9,
Square roots are very fine.
I like square roots, and you should, too,
They are very good for you.
Square roots, square roots,
They are very square roots.
Square roots are an exponent,
That is not you opponent.
I like bacon, and you should, too,
Though it isn't good for you.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>Multiplication</h3>
<p>Multiplication is so fun,
You can do it well eating a bun.
You can multiply anything,
Even "yams" and "a roasted wing"
Multiplication is so cool,
You can do it at school.
You should try jelly it tastes so sweet,
But multiplication makes it taste like feet.
Multiplication is so grand,
You can do it on the palm of your hand.
I once saw someone who wasn't cool,
Because he didn't learn multiplication at school.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>Powers of Ten</h3>
<p>One ten one hundred
One thousand ten thousand 
Hundred thousand million too
Powers of ten are good for you
<br>
Powers of ten
They never end
One zero zero
Zero zero zero
<br>
Easy to calculate
Divide multiply why wait
A one followed by some zeroes
I donâ€™t know what rhymes with zeroes
<br>
Powers of ten
They never end
One zero zero zero 
Zero zero zero
<br>
They can be less that ten
Like one tenth or hundredth
Take ten and multiply
It by itself some times
<br>
Powers of ten
They never end
One zero zero
Zero zero
